\section{Implement File System Calls}
\subsection{Overview}
In this task, we mainly need to implement system calls related to file system such as \texttt{create, open, read, write, close} and \texttt{unlink}
.
\subsection{Correctness Constraints}
\begin{compactitem}
\item Implement \texttt{creat, open, read, write, close} and \texttt{unlink}.
\item Bullet-proof those system calls.
\item \texttt{halt} can only be called from root process.
\item Each open file must have unique fiel descriptor and including standart input and output.
\item Be able to open 16 files simultaneously in a single process.
\end{compactitem}
\subsection{Declaration}
\begin{compactitem}
\item Declare new class \texttt{FileManager} in \texttt{UserKernel}. Remember each file's name, how many process open it, and whether it should
	be unlinked.
\item Declare an enclapsed \text{FileDescriptor} class recording the \texttt{OpenFile}, location.
\item Declare an array with length 16 of \texttt{FileDescriptor} \texttt{fileDescriptor}, prepare two \texttt{Openfile}: standart input and output.
\item \texttt{Create:}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[$\bullet$] read file name from virtual memory.
		\item[$\bullet$] call \texttt{open(String name, true)} and save the returned \texttt{Openfile}.
		\item[$\bullet$] save the \texttt{fileDescriptor} into the array \texttt{fileDescriptor}.
	\end{enumerate}
\item \texttt{Open:} Almost the same as \texttt{Create} but call \texttt{open(String name, false}.
\item \texttt{Read:}
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item Read the index of \texttt{FileDescriptor} ,the writing location of virtual memory \texttt{location} and the length of characters \texttt{count}.
		\item Pick the corresponding \texttt{FileDescriptor} and get the \texttt{Openfile} file, and call the method \texttt{file.read} to write the message into an array \texttt{buffer}.
		\item Write \texttt{buffer} into virtual memory, update the location.
	\end{compactitem}
\item \texttt{Write:}
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item Read the index of \texttt{FileDescriptor} ,the writing location of virtual memory \texttt{location} and the length of characters \texttt{count}.
		\item Pick the corresponding \texttt{FileDescriptor} and get the \texttt{Openfile} file, and read the message from virtual memory into an array \texttt{buffer}.
		\item Write \texttt{buffer} into the file, update the location.
	\end{compactitem}
\item \texttt{Close:}
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item Pick the corresponding \texttt{FileDescriptor}.
		\item Close the file.
		\item Decide whether to remove the file i.e. whether it is unlinked.
	\end{compactitem}
\item \texttt{Unlink:}
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item Read fileName and find corresponding file.
		\item If any processes still have the file open, the file will remain in existence until the last file descriptor referring to it is closed.
		\item If no process still have the file open, simply remove it.
	\end{compactitem}
\end{compactitem}
